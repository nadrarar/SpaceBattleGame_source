Space Battle Game Readme

Note: SpaceBattleGame_source is all of the source code of the private Space Battle Game repository.  The original repository contains assets and code, but we do not have the licence to distribute some assets publicly.

<b>Description:</b>  
Space Battle Game is an 3D dogfighting space simulator, inspired by games such as Star Fox 64 and Star Wars: Rogue Squadron.  The player controls a fighter ship, and gameplay primarily consists of dogfights with enemy fighters.  This game was made as a project for CS 638 - Software Engineering.

<b>How to play:</b>  
Note: Space Battle Game is currently only available for Windows.  
1.  Download Demo.zip by downloading the SpaceBattleGame_source repository from github, or by downloading Demo.zip from [Dropbox.com](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d4aplclt3d4bzdf/Demo.zip).  <b>Warning:</b> Google Chrome sometimes will give a warning that Demo.zip "is not commonly downloaded and could be dangerous."  Ignore this warning.  It seems to be caused by Demo.zip having a .exe file.  This .exe is used to run Space Battle Game, and so the warning is just a false positive.
